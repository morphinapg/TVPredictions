This week, CBS renewed The Neighborhood and Bob ♥ Abishola, and canceled NCIS: Los Angeles. Unfortunately, we somehow got all of these wrong. The Neighborhood we were closest on, because we had that listed as leaning towards cancellation with 0% confidence in that prediction, meaning it was right on the line between a renewal and cancellation prediction, and fell just slightly under. NCIS: Los Angeles was also close, as we had it leaning towards renewal with only a 9% confidence in a renewal prediction. Bob ♥ Abishola is however a bigger surprise, as we had that listed as a likely cancellation, with 55% confidence that it would be canceled, which is actually really close to going over the "certain cancellation" level. 

Comparing the prediction breakdown from last week to this, it looks like there may have been two main areas the previous AI model was misjudging. First, while a 22 episode order improved its chances, the current model estimates that the full season order improved its chances by about 35% more than previously estimated. Further, the previous model appears to have overestimated the standard by which CBS places on half hour shows compared to hour length shows, suggesting that CBS may be hoping to push more half hour shows through this season than in the past.

Unfortunately, these 3 misses bring us down to only prediction 6 of the 9 shows currently decided. I have now entered this data into the database and the AI has been retrained on it, so hopefully predictions will be more accurate for CBS going forward. 

Also this week, NBC premiered Night Court, to very good ratings. It starts out as a certain renewal, with 100% confidence that it will be renewed. Its ratings start out well above the expected renewal threshold for a show in its position, and that confidence level does include the margin of error for the variability in ratings from a premiere to the finale. It is very rare for a season or series premiere to start out with 100% confidence in renewal, so fans of that show should be happy.
