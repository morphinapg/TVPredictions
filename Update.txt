This week, CBS premiered Young Sheldon, CSI: Vegas, United States of Al, and Bull. Young Sheldon was already renewed for 2 more seasons before this season premiered, although under the current model, it's predicted to be just slightly under the renewal threshold, so fans of the show will be happy that they won't need to worry about ratings this season. CSI: Vegas on the other hand starts out leaning towards cancellation, and the other shows start out as likely cancellations.

CW premiered Nancy Drew this week. The prediction model currently has it at 100% confidence of renewal, but I would hold off on being fully confident about the show's fate until more shows have premiered on the network, as the prediction model is based on show ranking, and when there's only one show on the network, it ranks at exactly the midpoint for the network, which is usually considerably higher than where the renewal threshold is.
