In a surprise, FOX canceled The Resident. We actually had this predicted as a certain renewal with 99% confidence in that prediction, so this is a particularly surprising miss. The FOX model has been retrained and is now able to predict a target renewal threshold that gives some justification for the cancellation, so hopefully future predictions for shows in a similar state will be more accurate from now on.

On the other hand, ABC renewed Station 19, which we had also predicted as a certain renewal, so we got that one right at least. They also renewed The Good Doctor, which we had predicted as a likely renewal.
