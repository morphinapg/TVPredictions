Thanks for your patience. This week I was (and am still) moving and I also had an injury as well, so I wasn't able to get to the predictions until now.

Despite FOX premiering Monarch last week, this was really the big start to the Fall season, as we now have several shows on every network, aside from the CW, which starts its fall season in October. 

NBC premiered Chicago PD, Chicago Med, Law & Order: SVU, Chicago Fire, Law & Order: Organized Crime, Law & Order, Quantum Leap, and New Amsterdam. It was already announced that this would be the final season for New Amsterdam, so I won't be tracking that show. Of the rest, all of them are predicted as certain renewals except for the newcomer, Quantum Leap, which starts out as a likely cancellation. 

CBS premiered FBI: Most Wanted, FBI: International, FBI, NCIS, NCIS: Hawai'i, Bob ❤️ Abishola, and The Neighborhood. The FBI shows were renewed before the season starts, so unless the next season of those shows get announced as final seasons, we will not be following those shows. The NCIS shows both start out as leaning towards renewal, and the other two shows begin as leaning towards cancellation. 

FOX premiered 9-1-1, The Resident, and The Cleaning Lady. 9-1-1 and The Resident start out predicted as certain renewals, but The Cleaning Lady starts out predicted as a certain cancellation. For some reason, the chart shows Monarch as a new show this week, and I'm not sure why, but hopefully that gets sorted out next week.

ABC premiered The Conners, Abbott Elementary, The Goldbergs, Big Sky, and Home Economics, The Conners starts out predicted as a certain renewal, Abbott Elementary is predicted to be a likely renewal. The Goldbergs and Big Sky are both predicted as leaning towards renewal, and Home Economics starts out as a likely cancellation.
