This week, the CW premiered the first season of The Chosen. Not only have further seasons already been produced, but the CW has already ordered them, so fans of the show on this network will be happy, because if the show wasn't already renewed, I would have predicted a likely cancellation based on those ratings. CW may not be as happy with its performance.

The Wonder Years drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

Coroner drops from a likely to certain cancellation.

Family Law upgrades all the way from a certain cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

Moonshine upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
