This week, CBS renewed Fire Country. We had this as leaning towards renewal, so while it might have been close, we got this one right! So far we're 3 for 3 with correct predictions, although there have been a surprisingly low number of renewals and cancellations at this point in the year.

ABC also premiered Will Trent, which had good enough ratings to start out predicted as a likely renewal.

The Simpsons and Family Guy both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

Ghosts, 9-1-1, Bob's Burgers, and S.W.A.T. all upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Home Economics and Blue Bloods both upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
