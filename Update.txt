This week, CBS renewed S.W.A.T. This one does come as somewhat of a surprise, as we did have that one predicted as a likely cancellation. While the show was rated above where CBS normally has been renewing shows, the model had assumed there were other factors that meant CBS would likely want a higher rating than that from S.W.A.T. 

FOX renewed The Cleaning Lady. This one on the other hand, we got right, although it was close as we had this show predicted canceled for a while, and it was expected to be very close to the renewal threshold.

Charmed drops all the way from a certain renewal to a certain cancellation. Looking at the breakdown, it seems the model is now much more strongly factoring in how airing on friday and premiering in the spring impact renewal requirements for this show, which increased it's projected renewal threshold from 0.04 to 0.09. It's currently projected to end the season around a 0.06 rating.

Magnum P.I. upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Young Rock drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

Our Kind of People and United States of Al both drop from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.
