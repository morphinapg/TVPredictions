This week CW premiered Pandora, to underwhelming ratings. It starts out leaning towards cancellation. 

Also this week were minor changes to previous announcements. Agents of SHIELD was previously renewed for Season 7 before Season 6 even aired, which was particularly surprising given it was low enough to be canceled last year. Well, this week ABC announced that Season 7 will be the final season. In terms of the prediction model, this will count partially towards cancellation, just as any other "renewed for final season" news would normally.

Also, FOX previously announced that The Orville was renewed, but it turns out that while a third season will be produced, it will no longer air on FOX. Instead, it will move to Hulu.

On NBC, AP Bio was previously canceled, but it turns out they've changed their mind as well, and will produce the next season exclusively for their streaming service. 

This week, Ransom drops from likely renewed to leaning towards cancellation.

Reef Break upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
