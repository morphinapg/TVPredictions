This week, CW premiered The Flash and Riverdale. The Flash starts out as a certain renewal, and Riverdale starts out just leaning towards renewal.

This week I've also modified how the confidence calculation is done for the predictions, better taking into account an adjustment that is made to account for the differences we see earlier in the season when less shows have premiered on the network. This means that many predictions will be considered less confident this week than they were last week, but I'd say this does a better job representing the reliability of the predictions earlier in the season vs later. It expands the margin of error based on how much of an adjustment has been made to the "target rating" calculation, and then performs the same confidence calculation as before, just based on the higher margin of error now instead of the original.

That being said, the main changes to predictions this week are:

Bob ♥️ Abishola, NCIS Hawai'i, Legends of Tomorrow, FBI: Most Wanted, The Good Doctor, Blue Bloods, S.W.A.T., NCIS: Los Angeles, Magnum P.I., Big Sky, United States of Al, The Wonder Years, B Positive, and FBI: International all drop from certain renewals to just likely renewed.

The Resident upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Nancy Drew and Batwoman both drop from likely renewals to just leaning renewed.

4400 upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

CSI: Vegas upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
