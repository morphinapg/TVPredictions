This week, CBS renewed Ghosts, The Neighborhood, and Bob ♥️ Abishola. Ghosts and The Neighborhood were predicted as certain renewals, and Bob ♥️ Abishola was predicted as a likely renewal, so no surprises there. CBS also canceled Bull. We did get this one wrong, as we had it predicted as a likely renewal, but given some of the news that has come out about the show lately, it's not too surprising.

CW premiered Two Sentence Horror Stories. Its ratings are just barely high enough to earn a renewal, but it would not take much for it to drop into cancellation territory, so it starts out leaning towards renewal. Remember though, while we wait for the news about CW's sale, take any CW predictions with a grain of salt.

This week I've also made a modification to the adjustment calculation that is intended to account for the differences in the earlier season vs the later season ratings. It originally adjusted the renewal thresholds based on the average renewal level vs the highest rated show. While this was mostly a good idea, I figured that if there's a large outlier for a season, it could throw this calculation off. So I instead, adjusted it to the level that represents the 75% point of the cumulative ratings. Based on the way I weigh the calculation, this usually ends up anywhere from 1-3 shows from the top, but will be a better representation of "high" ratings for the network, without being affected by outliers.

The more renewals or cancellations a network has, the less this adjustment affects that network anyway, but some networks were still being affected to a larger degree by the old calculation than they are with the new calculation, so you may see some major changes in some predictions.
