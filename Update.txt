This week, CBS premiered The Equalizer, East New York, Fire Country, Blue Bloods, and S.W.A.T. The Equalizer was already renewed before the season started, but we would have predicted it as a certain renewal anyway based on those ratings. East New York starts out predicted as a likely renewal, whereas the others are predicted as just leaning towards renewal.

ABC premiered Grey's Anatomy, Station 19, The Good Doctor, and Alaska Daily. Grey's Anatomy and Station 19 both start out predicted as certain renewals. The Good Doctor starts out as a likely renewal, and Alaska Daily starts out just leaning towards renewal.

CW premiered Kung Fu, Walker, Walker: Independence, Coroner, and Family Law. Family Law was already renewed in Canada, so we start out with the assumption that CW will do the same, although its ratings are below what CW might have preferred, so that may not be the case. Kung Fu and both Walker shows start out predicted as certain renewals, and Coroner is predicted as leaning towards cancellation. Although the AI model is unable to factor this in, I did read that the main star of Coroner left the show after this season, so that would further support the idea of the show being canceled after this season.

Also this week, The Rookie drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

The Rookie: Feds and So Help Me Todd both drop from likely renewals to just leaning renewed.

Ghosts and Bob ❤️ Abishola both upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Big Sky drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

The Neighborhood and CSI: Vegas both upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
