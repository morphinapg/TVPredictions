This week, CBS canceled So Help Me Todd and CSI: Vegas. Both of these were really close predictions, as we had both predicted as just leaning towards cancellation, with CSI: Vegas having 2% confidence in that prediction, and So Help Me Todd with 0% confidence in that prediction. Any small bump could have pushed both of these into renewal territory, so we just barely got those predictions right.

CBS also renewed Elsbeth, which we had predicted as a likely cancellation, so we got that one wrong.

So far we've gotten 22 out of 24 predictions right this year.


Son of a Critch and Walker both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

Lopez vs. Lopez upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

The Swarm upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

Alert and Sight Unseen both upgrade from certain cancellations to just likely canceled.
