This week, ABC premiered Not Dead Yet and A Million Little Things. A Million Little Things was already decided to be the final season, and it seems the network probably made the right choice there, as the prediction for this show would have been leaning towards cancellation, so for the fans, it will be better that the show ends properly rather than being canceled unexpectedly. Not Dead Yet started out okay, getting enough ratings to give it an initial prediction of leaning towards renewal.

The final season of The Flash also premiered this week. Fans may be disappointed that this is the final season, as the ratings here would suggest that renewal is certainly possible. If it weren't for the decision already having been made, I would have given the Flash a prediction of likely renewal. That being said, it does not surprise me that the show is ending soon, because of the change in leadership at the CW, but also the change in leadership at DC Comics, who now appear to be planning a connected universe of movies, tv, and games, so the old format of Arrowverse TV shows may not have fit into that new plan anyway, even if it performed well enough for a renewal.
