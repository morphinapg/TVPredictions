This week, Bump drops from a certain renewal to just leaning renewed.

Son of a Critch upgrades from a likely to a certain renewal.

Run the Burbs upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to a likely renewal.

As I mentioned before, now that we're in September, the prediction models got recalculated with a different weighting of how important previous years of renewals and cancellations are to the model, so some of these prediction changes are a result of that, but it doesn't appear to have made a big difference.
