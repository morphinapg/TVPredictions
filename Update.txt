So now we begin the predictions for the 2023-2024 TV season! CW premiered three shows for the fall season this week: Children Ruin Everything, The Swarm, and The Chosen. The Chosen was already renewed before it began airing, and the other two shows start out predicted as leaning towards renewal.

Also this week, ABC canceled The Wonder Years. We were 95% confident that it would be canceled, so this is no surprise. It will be harder from now on to report on shows from last season being renewed or canceled, simply due to the way I keep track of those things, but if I miss any, they should still be reported in the highlights in the app.

Predictions for the fall will start out fairly slow because of the ongoing strikes, but as soon as any new network shows start airing, I will be tracking them here.
