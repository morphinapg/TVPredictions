This week, CBS premiered NCIS: Los Angeles to okay ratings. It starts out leaning towards renewal.

CW premiered All American, All American: Homecoming, The Winchesters, and Professionals. The All American Shows both start out predicted as certain renewals, while The Winchesters starts out just leaning towards renewal, and Professionals starts out as a likely cancellation. It should be noted that Professionals aired in another country over a year ago, and wasn't renewed there, so while it's still possible for CW to renew it, it seems unlikely, even if it had better ratings. Especially with Brendan Frasier's involvement, since he's gaining in popularity. However, again, as with all CW predictions, take all of these predictions with a grain of salt until we have a better understanding of how the new CW owners will handle the business.
