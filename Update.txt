This week, NBC premiered Lopez vs. Lopez. It had okay ratings, so it starts out leaning towards renewal.

CW also premiered All American, Walker, and Sight Unseen. All American performed the best, so it starts out predicted as a certain renewal. Walker performed just okay, so it starts out leaning towards renewal, but Sight Unseen had underwhelming ratings, so it starts out leaning towards cancellation.

CBS renewed FBI, The Neighborhood, FBI: International, NCIS, and FBI: Most Wanted. We predicted all of these correctly. We had FBI as a certain renewal, The Neighborhood as a likely renewal, and the others only leaning renewed, so we were close to being wrong on some of those, but still right.

ABC renewed Will Trent. We had this predicted as a certain renewal.

NBC canceled Quantum Leap. First surprise of the year. We had this one predicted as a likely renewal.
