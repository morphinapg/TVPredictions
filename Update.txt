There were no major changes to the ratings this week, but further training of the AI models for NBC and CW has resulted in a few changes in predictions:

Law & Order: Organized Crime and All American both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

Kung Fu drops all the way from a likely renewal to a likely cancellation.

Walker: Independence upgrades from a likely cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
