This week I've published a new version of the app which should load images quicker, and also makes use of the changes I talked about last week for how I categorize CW show ownership. This also means there may be some more significant changes to CW show predictions as I had to retrain the prediction model again.


Home Economics drops all the way from a certain renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

9-1-1 and Bob's Burgers both drop from likely renewals to just leaning renewed.

All American, Walker, and The Rookie: Feds all upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Welcome to Flatch and Walker: Independence both drop from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

The Winchesters upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

Kung Fu upgrades all the way from a likely cancellation to a likely renewal.

Professionals and The Resident both drop from likely to certain cancellations.
