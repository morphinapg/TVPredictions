This week, FOX premiered Grimsburg and The Great North. Grimsburg was already renewed before it aired, although based on these ratings, it would have just barely been predicted as a renewal, so fans of the show will be relieved, although FOX may be questioning their decision at this point. Although with FOX animation, the numbers can vary wildly week to week, so it can be hard to say this early. The Great North on the other hand performed quite poorly, and starts out predicted as a likely cancellation.

NBC premiered the final season of La Brea. Fans of the show will likely be happy that the show will get a proper ending, because with these ratings, it almost certainly would have been canceled otherwise.

CW premiered the third season of Children Ruin Everything, with okay ratings. It starts out leaning towards renewal. Which is interesting because I had never seen the news that Children Ruin Everything was picked up for the third season, but that apparently happened in the middle of December. Either way, the last prediction we had for Season 2 of Children Ruin Everything was a likely renewal, so we got that one right.

The Chosen upgrades from a likely to certain renewal. 

Bob's Burgers drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.
