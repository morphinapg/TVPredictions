This week, CW premiered the 4th and final season of Wellington Paranormal. It's probably a good thing that this was planned as the final season, because its ratings do not currently look like they would have been good enough for a renewal. Also on CW, next season of The Flash was announced as the final season, so I've updated the database to reflect that. I would say that there's a good chance you'll be seeing more of this for the other renewed CW shows, as after the recent sale, and news that these shows are not profitable, I expect you'll either see massive changes to the shows (like much shorter seasons), or they'll be canceled in favor of cheaper programming, like reruns of old shows, or reality TV. Considering CW shows are already cheap as it is, I don't know if they can realistically make them any cheaper and still retain any of their talent.
