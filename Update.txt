This week, CW premiered Stargirl. It starts out as a likely renewal, although as I said before, take any predictions on CW shows with a grain of salt at the moment. The company that will be taking over CW over the next year is likely to do things very different, and I would be surprised if any current CW programming survives beyond their existing contracts. Unfortunately, these predictions use an AI model that has no way of factoring in details like that, so it can only look to how CW has operated in recent years. If Nexstar somehow makes decisions the same way CW has for the last several years, then sure, Stargirl would be a likely renewal, but it would not surprise me if it got canceled, much like the better performing Flash series has been (after the upcoming season is over)

Once we start getting data for how Nexstar will be operating the CW, predictions will become much more useful for that network.
