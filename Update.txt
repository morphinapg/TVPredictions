This week, CW renewed a bunch of shows: All American, Walker, Superman & Lois, The Flash, Kung Fu, Riverdale, and Nancy Drew. Personally, I wasn't expecting this, due to the fact that CW is selling its network, and recent news showed that the network has almost never made a profit. Based on that information, I would expect that any potential buyer would not be continuing CW's business model, and would either make their own shows, or mostly show repeats of older shows. As such, I was expecting nearly all of CW's content to be canceled, aside from maybe a show or two that might be picked up for streaming purposes. This news to me suggests that the CW is either not making a sale any time soon, or if they are, then the sale won't go into full effect until at least partway through next season, meaning the shows would already be in production by then. Either way, despite my own opinions on this, the prediction model (which is unable to account for the sale) had indeed correctly predicted all of these shows!

Also this week, FOX premiered Welcome to Flatch. The ratings were considerably lower than they would need to be for renewal, so this starts out predicted to be a certain cancellation.
