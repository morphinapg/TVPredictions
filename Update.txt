This week, CW canceled Bump, as they have pulled it from the schedule. Although this show was already renewed in its original country, apparently CW felt the ratings weren't good enough on their network to renew it here. We had this predicted as leaning towards renewal, so that one's a miss, although not by much.

Coroner drops from a likely to certain cancellation.

That's it for the news this week. As we get closer to the new fall season, there will be less and less news for the 2022-2023 season shows. I will continue tracking them, but some news may wait a while, especially with the strikes going on. One in particular I'm curious about is The Rookie: Feds. The ratings on that show suggest it should have been a lock for renewal, yet there was no news about it. Perhaps they were in the middle of figuring out contract deals when the strikes began. If so, the delays could potentially cause problems for renewal, despite the good ratings.
