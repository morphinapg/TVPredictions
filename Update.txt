This week, CBS renewed Ghosts and Fire Country. We had both predicted as likely renewals, so no surprise there. So far we have predicted 6 out of 6 shows correctly this year.

ABC premiered 9-1-1, Grey's Anatomy, and Station 19. 9-1-1 performed very well, so it starts out predicted as a certain renewal, while Grey's Anatomy is predicted as a likely renewal. Station 19 was already announced to be the final season. The ratings it got are just barely enough that they could have justified another season, but they're close enough to the line that cancellation may still be reasonable.

NCIS drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

The Rookie and FBI: Most Wanted both drop from likely renewals to just leaning renewed.

The Chosen upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Children Ruin Everything upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

FBI: International and Extended Family both upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Not Dead Yet drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Elsbeth and The Spencer Sisters both drop from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

The Great North upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

Alert drops from a likely to certain cancellation.
