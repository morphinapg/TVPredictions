Sorry about the delay, I was too busy last week to work on the predictions so this update will cover the last two weeks.

The CW premiered the second season of Family Law, and the first season of Moonshine. Both of these shows were created in Canada and have already been renewed for the next season there, but just because a show was renewed in its original country, doesn't mean it will also be renewed here. Both shows had significantly lower ratings than I expect CW was hoping for, which leads to both of them starting out predicted as certain cancellations.

Home Economics upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

The Wonder Years upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

Coroner upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
