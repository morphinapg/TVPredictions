This week, CW announced it plans to air the final season of Wellington Paranormal. This show was already renewed and aired in New Zealand, but because this was announced during the airing of season 3, I will count this as a renewal on the data for CW's prediction model. While this show didn't previously have a prediction, the prediction model would have suggested it to be leaning towards cancellation, so this will help improve the prediction model for the CW going forward, although because of the change in ownership, who knows how useful that will be.

That's it for this week.
