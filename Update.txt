This week, CW canceled Batwoman and Legends of Tomorrow. Batwoman is a surprise, as we had that predicted as a certain renewal, but Legends of Tomorrow was predicted as leaning towards cancellation, so while close, we got that one right. That being said, while Batwoman was predicted as a renewal, this year, renewal predictions have been in question for the CW, since they are in the process of selling the ownership of the network. It's possible that while Batwoman may have been performing well enough for the existing onwership to renew it, it may not be something potential buyers are interested in. There's also the possibility that they want to leave enough room open on the schedule for the potential buyers to be able to fit their own content on. When the UPN/WB merger to CW happened, similarly some shows you normally would have expected to be renewed were canceled in favor of opening the door for new CW original content. So it's quite possible there will be more of these unexpected cancellations, although for now the only shows I still have predicted as renewals on the CW are Two Sentence Horror Stories, All American: Homecoming, and Legacies.

All American: Homecoming drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

Young Rock upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

How We Roll drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

Naomi drops from a likely to certain cancellation.

Mr. Mayor upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
