This week NBC renewed La Brea. While the prediction model had indeed changed to predicting this one as a renewal before it happened, I go by the last officially posted prediction, which last week was leaning towards cancellation. So it's a miss, but not a surprising one, and one we would have gotten right if NBC had waited another week ðŸ˜‚.

The Resident and The Rookie both drop from certain renewals to just likely renewed.

FBI: International upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Home Economics drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

Batwoman upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

A Million Little Things drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

Legends of Tomorrow upgrades all the way from leaning towards cancellation to a certain renewal.

Nancy Drew upgrades from a likely cancellation to a likely renewal.

CSI: Vegas drops from a likely to certain cancellation.
