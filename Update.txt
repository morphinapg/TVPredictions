This week, CBS premiered a whopping 14 shows! Tracker premiered the strongest with extremely high ratings, but it premiered directly after the superbowl, so the current projected end season rating of 3.24 is based on the first episode alone, and will likely be adjusted next week to a much lower number, given the second episode's ratings. For now though, it starts out predicted as a certain renewal. Unfortunately, because of the skewed ratings of tracker, this has disproportionately skewed the rest of CBS's lineup to look worse than it actually is. So I would take the rest of these with a grain of salt, as I'd expect almost all of them to improve next week:

Leaning Towards Renewal: Ghosts

Leaning Towards Cancellation: Fire Country, NCIS: Hawai'i

Likely Canceled: FBI: Most Wanted, So Help Me Todd, FBI, FBI: International, and NCIS

CBS also premiered Blue Bloods, S.W.A.T., Bob ❤️ Abishola, and Young Sheldon, but all of these shows are planned to be the final seasons. Normally I would comment on whether that was a good choice or not, but because of CBS's skewed ratings right now, it's probably best to wait until later on in the season to comment on that.

Son of a Critch upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

The Swarm drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

SEAL Team drops all the way from a likely renewal to a certain cancellation. 

NCIS: Sydney drops all the way from leaning towards renewal to a certain cancellation.

Family Law and Children Ruin Everything both drop from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

The Spencer Sisters drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

Again, the drops of the other CBS shows are likely temporary because of the skewed ratings on CBS right now. Over the next few weeks these large changes should stabilize.
