Sorry about the delay. I was hoping to get these predictions out yesterday, but I got too busy. Although, due to this timing, now I can include the renewal of The Goldbergs on ABC. Of course, we were 100% confident of a renewal in that show, so this is no surprise.

9-1-1: Lone Star drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

Women of the Movement upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Magnum P.I. drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

Blue Bloods upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Young Rock upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

United States of Al upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

How We Roll upgrades from a certain cancellation to just leaning canceled.

Naomi upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
