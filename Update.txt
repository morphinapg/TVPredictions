This week, CBS premiered True Lies, but the ratings were below what the network likely was hoping for, so it starts out predicted as a likely cancellation.

NBC premiered new seasons of The Blacklist and Grand Crew. It has already been announced that this will be the final season of The Blacklist. If that wasn't already announced, it would have started out predicted as leaning towards cancellation, so the network is likely making the right choice here. Grand Crew on the other hand had much lower ratings than the network would likely have wanted, so it starts out predicted as a certain cancellation.

Grey's Anatomy and The Good Doctor both drop from a certain renewals to just leaning renewed. 

Home Economics drops all the way from a certain renewal to a likely cancellation.

Will Trent drops all the way from a certain renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

Some of these changes for ABC shows are likely due to a change in the prediction model for ABC, following the cancellation of The Goldbergs, which was predicted as a certain renewal, so some predictions on ABC appear to have lowered confidence in a potential renewal.
