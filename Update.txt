Sorry about the delay, once again this has been a busy week. 

The only change to the predictions this week though is that Stargirl ugrades from a likely to certain renewal. But again, as with any CW prediction, take it with a grain of salt until we learn how the new owners will operate.

We should however start seeing some fall 2022 shows premiering next week. If enough new shows premiere next week, this may be the last time I post some of the prediction updates from the 2021-2022 season.
