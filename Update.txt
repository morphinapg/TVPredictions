This week ABC finally started airing their first shows for the 2023-2024 season! They premiered Abbott Elementary, The Conners, and Not Dead Yet. Before I even had a chance to make a prediction, Abbott Elementary was already renewed for another season. That being said, it would have been predicted as a certain renewal, so that's no surprise. The Conners starts out predicted as a likely renewal, and Not Dead Yet starts out predicted as leaning towards cancellation.

Quantum Leap drops from a certain renewal to just likeely renewed.

Son of a Critch upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Children Ruin Everything upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.
