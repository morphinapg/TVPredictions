This week, CW premiered two shows, Son of a Critch and Children Ruin Everything. Both of these shows originally aired in Canada, and have already been renewed there, but whether or not CW renews them will depend on their ratings here. Both shows had high enough ratings to be predicted as likely renewals.

Family Law drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Moonshine drops from a likely to certain cancellation.
