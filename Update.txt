This week, Devils upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Note that next week the predictions for this past season may shift around a bit, as the algorithm changes the weights to account for the upcoming 2022-2023 season. Although, as soon as any network has at least two shows that have premiered in September (or later), I will begin focusing on the 2022-2023 predictions for those shows. Any future predictions for the 2021-2022 season shows will still be tracked in my database, so you will still be able to find them in the app, and I will update you if any of those shows get renewed or canceled, but once new fall shows start premiering, these updates will be focused on those.
