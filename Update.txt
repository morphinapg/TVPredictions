This week, NBC renewed Chicago Med, Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, Law & Order: Organized Crime, Law & Order: SVU, and Law & Order. All 3 Chicago shows, and both Law & Order spinoffs were predicted as certain renewals, and the original Law & Order was predicted as a likely renewal, so none of these are a surprise.

Will Trent upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Fantasy Island drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

Not Dead Yet and Superman & Lois both upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Gotham Knights and Home Economics both upgrade from leaning renewed to certain renewals.

The Company You Keep drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.
