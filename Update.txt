This week, CW premiered two shows, the first season of Run the Burbs, and the second season of Bump. Both shows have already been renewed in their original countries, with those seasons having already aired there, but whether or not CW renews them will depend on their performance here. Run the Burbs looks like it had enough viewers, as it starts out predicted as a likely renewal, but a very small number of people watched Bump, earning a projected rating of only 0.01, meaning it starts out predicted as a certain cancellation.

Children Ruin Everything drops from a likely renewal to leaning canceled.

Home Economics drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Family Law upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

The Wonder Years drops from a likely to certain cancellation.

Coroner upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
