Well, it turns out I have completely missed a show, both this year as well as in the 2020-2021 TV season. I was under the impression that Fantasy Island was a reality TV show for whatever reason, and so I haven't been tracking it, but I just added the first and second season to the database this week. So I apologize for missing this show for so long, but now that it's tracked, the rating appears to be just under where I would expect FOX would want it to be to renew, so the starting prediction is leaning towards cancellation.

Also this week, Magnum P.I. and The Good Doctor both upgrade from leaning renewed to certain renewals.

Grey's Anatomy upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

The Company You Keep and Not Dead Yet both drop from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Will Trent upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to a likely renewal.

Call Me Kat and Welcome to Flatch both upgrade from likely cancellations to just leaning canceled.

Big Sky and Home Economics both upgrade from a likely cancellations to leaning towards renewal.

True Lies drops from a likely to certain cancelllation.

Alaska Daily and Alert both upgrade from certain cancellations to just likely canceled.
