This week, CW premiered the show Bump. Based on the ratings, I would have predicted it to be leaning towards renewal, but it was already renewed be its original network in Australia. Whether CW will decide to air the second or third season does not appear to be decided yet, so these ratings may still be important for that, but because the show was already renewed overseas, we won't be tracking it with predictions.
