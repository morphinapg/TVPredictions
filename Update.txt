As you might have noticed, a lot of shows on CBS seem to have lowered their predictions. Looking at the data for CBS, I would imagine this is because one of the higher rated shows, FBI, received a big ratings bump this week, which both caused a shift in the relative positions of the other shows, as well as an increase in the expected typical renewal threshold for the network, which was 0.42 last week and rose to 0.46 this week. This has resulted in no shows receiving a likely renewal or higher prediction, and probably too many shows being predicted as cancellation. It's possible this may just be an error in the prediction model that a future model could improve on, or it could just be the result of this week's unexpectedly high ratings for FBI. Either way, more ratings data will help going forward, and I will also continue training the AI models for every network, as there's still a ways to go with how accurate they can get, although the best results will happen once these networks start making renewal or cancellation decisions of rthis year's shows.
