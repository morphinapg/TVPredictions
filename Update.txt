This week, FOX premiered BH90210 to great ratings. It starts out as a certain renewal. CW premiered Bulletproof and Two Sentence Horror Stories. Bulletproof had lower than ideal ratings, so it starts out leaning towards cancellation, but being a foreign produced show, CW's ratings may not matter as much for renewal (although this is factored into the model). Two Sentence Horror Stories had much lower ratings than it would need for renewal, so it starts out as a certain cancellation.

Also this week, Pandora upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
