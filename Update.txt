This week, CW announced that The 100 would be ending next year. As I explained last week, when a show is already announced as renewed before it airs, and the after it airs, it's announced that the next season will be the last, that is indicative that the ratings were lower than anticipated. Statistically, this will count the same as a cancellation, which will help predictions in the future to be more accurate.

The Outpost upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to a likely renewal.
