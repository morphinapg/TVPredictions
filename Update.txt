This week, in surprising news, FOX renewed 9-1-1: Lone Star, but not the original 9-1-1. Instead, ABC renewed that show. This is surprising because 9-1-1 was the best rated show on FOX and had the highest chances of renewal. Now, while this technically counts as a cancellation on FOX, it's hard to say exactly what happened business wise. It's possible FOX would have renewed the show, but Disney, who owns the show, decided not to renew their agreement with FOX, and decided to bring the show to their own network. 9-1-1 is one of many shows produced by the old FOX. While the channel retains the FOX name, it's a different company now, as Disney bought all the studios and content from the old FOX, including this show. So originally, the studio owned the show and the network, but after the Disney deal, the same studio, now operated by Disney, owned the show but no longer owned the network, meaning they don't get quite as much of a cut of the profits if the show does well. So it does make sense to move it to their own network, but the confusing part of this is why Lone Star stayed on FOX. It may not perform as well, but it does still perform well above ABC's standards for most shows, and it's certainly strange to see a franchise split across two networks. Anyway, we predicted that both shows would be certain renewals. It's not easy to score 9-1-1, because technically we were both right and wrong at the same time, but at least we can say we got Lone Star right. I've also placed 9-1-1 on the ABC chart now so that you can see how it compares to the other shows on that network. Similarly, if the show was on ABC the entire season, I would have also predicted it as a certain renewal, which is not surprising, considering it had better ratings than any other ABC show this year.

Superman & Lois and Gotham Knights both upgrade all the way from leaning renewed to certain renewals.

Welcome to Flatch upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

The Company You Keep drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Walker upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

Home Economics drops from a likely to certain cancellation.

HouseBroken upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.


Next week will probably be the last time I'm able to make predictions for most of the remaining shows, as the final renewals and cancellations will be happening that week or so for most remaining shows.
