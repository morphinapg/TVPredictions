This weekend, CBS renewed NCIS, NCIS: Hawai'i, and NCIS: Los Angeles. While the previous predictions had considered NCIS: Hawaii as a sure bet for renewal, NCIS: Los Angeles was only predicted as leaning towards renewal, and the main NCIS was actually listed as leaning towards cancellation. So that one is a miss. Not a surprising one, as the cancellation prediction didn't have a high confidence level, but I believe this was the first time NCIS was actually predicted to be canceled, so it's possible it may not last much longer, with the main factor there being the cost of production rising as the number of seasons gets high.

ABC also renewed The Good Doctor and The Rookie. We had both of these listed as likely renewals, so no surprises there.

This week also saw the premiere of How We Roll on CBS. Its ratings started out much lower than CBS would likely want them to be for renewal, so this show starts out predicted to be a certain cancellation.
