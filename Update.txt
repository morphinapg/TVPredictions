It seems I missed a show that premiered a few weeks ago on NBC, Found. Based on the ratings so far, it starts out predicted as a certain renewal.

Also, this week CW premiered new seasons of Son of a Critch and Run the Burbs. Both of these shows were already renewed before they started airing these new episodes, but the model would have predicted them as renewals anyway, so CW is likely making the right call here. CW also premiered a new show, Everyone Else Burns, which has also already been renewed before it aired, although in this case, the model would have predicted a cancellation, so CW may be regretting that renewal based on those early ratings. 

The Irrational drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

Bob's Burgers and Family Guy both upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

The Spencer Sisters and CHildren Ruin Everything both drop from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

The Simpsons drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.
