As you might have seen in my Facebook post last week, I modified the way the prediction AI works when it's earlier in the season. Networks have a tendency to start airing their best rated shows first in the fall, which has a tendency of impacting the reliability of my predictions earlier on. To remedy this, I have modified my prediction algorithm for current year shows to take into account where the typical renewal threshold would normally be, compared to the top rated shows on the network right now. An adjustment is made so that the calculated typical renewal threshold for the network in the current year matches the percentage of maximum ratings that we normally see in previous years. As more shows become renewed or canceled throughout the year, this adjustment will be reduced. As you might see in the results below, this has considerably changed the predictions from last week. I'm confident that these changes are more realistically reflective of the show's status than these predictions typically have been at this point in the TV season. 

This week, CW canceled Pandora. We had this predicted as a certain cancellation, so this is no surprise. For fans of the show, they may be happy to hear that the production of the next season still seems to be happening, so it's likely that another channel will be picking it up for that season.

Also this week, NBC premiered The Blacklist, to underwhelming ratings. It starts out leaning towards cancellation.

ABC premiered Queens, to okay ratings. It starts out leaning towards renewal.

Now for the large list of changes to predictions this week after the prediction engine overhaul:

The Resident, The Equalizer, Station 19, S.W.A.T., The Neighborhood, and Ghosts all upgrade from likely renewed to certain renewals.

Nancy Drew drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.
