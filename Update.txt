Sorry for the delay for this week's predictions. Once again, news kept coming in while I was still processing the ratings, which requires me to reprocess the data before I can generate new predictions. 

As I said before, Night Court was predicted as a certain renewal with 100% confidence in that prediction, and as expected, it has been renewed. NBC also renewed La Brea, which was predicted as a likely renewal. Deadline also reported that this renewal is for a shorter final season, so I've marked it as such. Renewals for final seasons affect the prediction model in a slightly different way than full renewals, because they're seen as shows that have ratings that are just barely good enough for renewal, but the next season is unlikely to hit that mark. 

FOX also renewed The Simpsons for 2 seasons. We had this predicted as a likely renewal, so no surprise. Family Guy and Bob's Burgers were also renewed for 2 seasons each. We had these leaning towards renewal, so while the prediction was correct, a renewal for 2 seasons is surprising given their ratings. Even more surprising is the renewal of The Cleaning Lady, which we had predicted as a likely cancellation.

CBS renewed So Help Me Todd. We had this one leaning towards cancellation, but were only 1% confident that it would be canceled, which means it was close to 50/50 odds, so a renewal is not particularly surprising, but still a miss.

This week, NBC premiered the new season of American Auto, which performed well below where I expect it would need to be renewed. It starts out predicted as a certain cancellation.

FOX premiered Accused and the new season of 9-1-1: Lone Star. Accused started out well below where the network would likely want it to be, so it starts out predicted as a certain cancellation. 9-1-1: Lone Star on the other hand, performed fairly well, so it starts out predicted as a likely renewal.

Will Trent drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

The Rookie: Feds and All American: Homecoming both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

The Resident upgrades from leaning renewed to a certain renewal.

Walker: Independence drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

Alert upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.
