This week, ABC canceled Women of the Movement. While this show was listed as a limited series, it's always possible for a network to come up with a way to continue the show if the ratings are high enough. Based on its ratings, we were in fact predicting that Women of the Movement would be a likely renewal, but it seems ABC will instead leave it as a limited series.

No other news this week.
