This week, ABC renewed Abbott Elementary. We had this predicted as a certain renewal, so this is not a surprise.

CW renewed All American. While the prediction model did have this as a certain renewal, I was personally still unsure whether the new owners would be continuing to order ANY programming from WB or CBS, but if they were going to renew even just one show, All American was my best guess for that.

CBS renewed Ghosts. We had this predicted as a likely renewal, so again, not a surprise. All in all, these predictions have correctly predicted all 5 renewals so far this year, as well as the one cancellation. So far that's a pretty good rate, although of course the early renewals or cancellations are more often the obvious choices.

Also this week, FOX premiered Alert. It received considerably lower ratings than FOX probably would have liked, so it starts out as a likely cancellation.

Family Guy drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

Will Trent drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

Home Economics and The Neighborhood both drop from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

NCIS: Los Angeles upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

NCIS: Hawai'i upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.
