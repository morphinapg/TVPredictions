This week, I updated and retrained the AI models for each network using a couple of new tags for each show. Like I did with CW a few weeks ago, I went through and checked which of the shows on each network going back as far as the database goes were produced for another network before being brought to this network. After that, I added a new tag which looks at whether a show makes use of expensive elements like VFX, action, or expensive sets. The best way I could determine this was by checking the genres in the wikipedia tab. If they listed Action, Sci-fi, Superhero, or supernatural, I would automatically tag them with that factor. Additionally, if the show was described as a fantasy, I would include it if the show did not take place in a mostly modern real world setting, and finally if the show is a period show, where it's far enough in the past to need extensive set, CGI, and costume work to deliver that period realistically, then I would also include those shows in this tag. 

The goal is to point out the shows that cost more to produce as opposed to the shows that don't use these more expensive elements, as differences in budget can absolutely affect the level at which renewal would be most likely. That being said, there's always a chance for me to have tagged some shows wrong. For example, maybe the show doesn't make use of traditionally expensive elements, but may have an expensive actor on the cast. Unfortunately, those type of situations are harder to track.

Because I had to retrain the AI on the new data, there will be some considerable changes in many of the predictions.
