This week, CBS renewed The Equalizer and canceled NCIS: Hawai'i. We had The Equalizer as a certain renewal, so no surprise there, but we had NCIS: Hawai'i as leaning towards renewal with a 0% confidence in that rating. It was just on the line, so we were close, but just barely got that one wrong. 

So far, we have 23/26 shows predicted correctly this year.
