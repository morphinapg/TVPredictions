Sorry about the delay. Last week was very busy for me, so I decided to wait and combine two weeks of ratings into one predictions update instead. 

In a major surprise, The Goldbergs was canceled. We had this predicted as a certain renewal, as the ratings were roughly 80% better than we expected the network would likely have needed to renew the show. My guess is it may have something to do with Jeff Garlin leaving the show due to some controversial behind the scenes issues, so perhaps the sudden change in the cast caused other issues in the production, or the creative team simply decided to end the show now. Unfortunately, situations like these can not be accounted for in a data-based prediction system.

CBS renewed NCIS. We had this as a likely renewal, so no surprise there. NCIS: Hawai'i was also renewed. We had this one as leaning towards renewal, so slightly less confident, but still correct. On the other hand, CBS renewed CSI: Vegas, which we had predicted as leaning towards cancellation. It was close enough that this isn't a surprising miss, but still a miss.

NBC premiered the new season of Magnum P.I., which started out with ratings just slightly above where NBC would likely need for it to be renewed, so for now, the prediction is just leaning towards renewal.

FOX premiered Animal Control, which didn't have the greatest ratings. It starts out predicted as a likely cancellation.

ABC premiered The Company You Keep, which had fairly good ratings, so it starts out predicted as a likely renewal.

Will Trent upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

Blue Bloods upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Call Me Kat upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

Kung Fu and The Winchesters both drop from likely to certain cancellations.
