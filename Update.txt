This week marks the beginning of the 2019-2020 season on NBC, FOX, ABC, and CBS. CW is still finishing up its 2018-2019 summer season, and next week will be the last predictions for that season with CW. 

Right now we're only going off of one week worth of data for these new shows, but the prediction model factors in the expected drop in ratings over the length of the season. As we get more weeks, however, we can develop a more precise ratings average for each show.

To start off, NBC premiered 11 shows, and our prediction model estimates that on average, shows that have ratings higher than 0.64 will typically be renewed, and those under will typically be canceled. Two shows will not be counted in our predictions this year, and those are This is Us and The Good Place. This is Us was renewed for 3 seasons this past spring, so no matter how it performs, it will be renewed. That being said, as it was last year, it's currently the top performing show on the network. The Good Place announced this season would be the final season, so again, the ratings don't matter for their outcome. Of the shows we are tracking for predictions, Chicago Fire is the most likely to be renewed, and Perfect Harmony and Sunnyside are the most likely shows to be canceled. 

FOX only premiered 4 shows this week, so with a smaller slate of shows, the predictions may be somewhat less useful, but we project that FOX will have a similar renewal threshold to NBC this year, around 0.64. It was announced that Empire would be the final season, so we won't be tracking that one, but so far, 9-1-1 performed the best, making it most likely to be renewed, and The Resident performed the worst, making it most likely to be canceled. However, The Resident is closer to the line on FOX, so it's possible other newer shows may drop below that, reducing it's chances of cancellation.

ABC premiered 16 shows, and is expected to have a renewal threshold around 0.6 this year. Modern Family and How to Get Away With Murder will have their final seasons this year, and Grey's Anatomy is already renewed for next year. ABC is surely not so happy that Modern Family is coming to an end, as it is currently the second best performing show on the network, relative to expectations. The top performing shows we're tracking on ABC are The Goldbergs and The Conners, which are both expected to be certain renewals, and Fresh Off the Boat performed the worst, expected to be a certain cancellation.

CBS premiered 15 shows this week, with Young Sheldon and Mom already renewed for next season. CBS is predicted to typically renew shows above approximately a 0.58 rating this year. The show most likely to be renewed on CBS right now is NCIS, with Carol's Second Act coming in as least likely to be renewed.

CW is still finishing up its Summer season. As some of you may have read, there was a small adjustment to the prediction model this week, so this affects all predictions, including those who haven't seen substantial ratings changes. Pandora drops from likely renewed to just leaning towards renewal.
