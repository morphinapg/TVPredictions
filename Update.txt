This week, NBC premiered La Brea to okay ratings. It starts out leaning towards renewal.

CBS premiered So Help Me Todd, Ghosts, Young Sheldon, and CSI: Vegas. So Help Me Todd starts out as a likely renewal, and Ghosts starts out just leaning towards renewal. Young Sheldon was already renewed before the season started, and fans of that show will be glad, because at least for now, the ratings aren't quite what the network was likely hoping for the show. CSI: Vegas starts out leaning towards cancellation.

ABC premiered The Rookie, and The Rookie: Feds. The Rookie starts out strong, with a prediction of a certain renewal, and The Rookie: Feds starts out as a likely renewal.

FOX premiered several shows: The Simpsons, The Great North, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Call Me Kat, and Welcome to Flatch. The Great North was already renewed before the season began, but it would have been predicted as a certain renewal anyway, so that's not surprising. The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and Family Guy all start out predicted to be certain renewals. Call Me Kat starts out as a likely cancellation, and Welcome to Flatch is predicted as a certain cancellation. To be fair though, Welcome to Flatch was consistently predicted as a certain cancellation last year, and somehow ended up being renewed anyway. It's possible this show is just extremely cheap, or does well in other markets.

Also this week, Law & Order: Organized Crime and Law & Order both drop from certain renewals to just likely renewd.

NCIS upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

Bob ❤️ Abishola upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

Home Economics and Quantum leap both upgrade from a likely cancellations to just leaning canceled.
