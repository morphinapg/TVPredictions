This week, FOX premiered the first show for the 2022-2023 season: Monarch. It starts out leaning towards renewal, although if these ratings hold up, that prediction will likely rise in confidence fairly quickly. The low confidence in the prediction is a combination of both the fact that it's the first week, as well as the fact that there are no other shows on the network to compare it to. Predictions primarily need to be based on comparisons to how the other shows on the network are performing, so without that data, it can be hard to make any reliable predictions. 

Next week though there should be more shows premiering, which should allow for much more interesting predictions. I will continue to monitor the shows that are still airing from the summer, but I won't be posting any more updates about their predictions here. If you're interested in the predictions for those, they will be available in the app if you switch the year to 2021.
