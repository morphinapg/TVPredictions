Sorry about the delay again this week. I was out of town last weekend and it caused a disruption in my schedule, so it took me a few days to recover. 

This week, CW premiered Gotham Knights and the new season of Superman & Lois. Both shows performed just barely above the minimum level that the CW would likely expect them to perform at, so they both start out predicted as leaning towards renewal, although with the network's ownership change, there's a good chance they get canceled as well.

In a surprising move, FOX renewed Alert and Accused. We had both of these predicted as cancellations, with Accused even being predicted as a certain cancllation, with 70% confidence in that prediction. At this time, the prediction model is still not able to make sense of that one, although with Alert it appears it was able to solve it by reducing the importance of some of the factors in its calculation, and focusing more on the raw ratings.

Not Dead Yet, Animal Control, and Welcome to Flatch all upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

Fantasy Island drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.
