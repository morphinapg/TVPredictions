As we're getting close to the new TV season, I went through and checked to make sure all of my ratings data and renewals/cancellations were all up to date, so you'll see a few adjustments for the rating number for shows that have been off the air for a while, and I also noticed that I had missed the cancellation news for two shows: Ransom on CBS, and I Ship It on CW. We had Ransom as leaning towards renewal, so that's a miss, but we had I Ship It as likely canceled.

This week, it appears the prediction model for FOX has changed substantially, because the prediction for BH90210 has dropped all the way from a likely renewal, to a certain cancellation, despite that show's rating actually increasing slightly.

The Outpost upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
