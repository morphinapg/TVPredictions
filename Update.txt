The time has come for the networks to announce their 2018-2019 schedules, and so we will finally get news for almost every show out now on whether they have been canceled or renewed. Many shows were announced earlier in this year, but this week should see most of the rest of them announced. A few shows that premiered later may not be announced until later.
Below you will see how the predictions for this year line up with the actual news. Shows will be sorted by their likelihood of renewal, with the confidence of the prediction listed in parentheses next to it (based on the last prediction posted before it was renewed or canceled). A ? next to the show indicates a correct prediction. An ? next to the show indicates an incorrect prediction. A tally will be listed at the bottom.
As new renewal/cancellation announcements come out, I will update this scoreboard and also comment on the post with the updated information.

Score: 73/92 (79%)
Throughout the year, as shows are renewed and canceled, I update my prediction model, and it improves. As such, many shows that have been incorrectly predicted earlier this season would have been correctly predicted if using the more updated model. Here are the statistics for that:
Score with current updated prediction model: 90/92 (98%)
(recalculated on 6/9/2019)

Some shows had their decisions announced before the seasons started. I will show what the prediction would have been based on their ratings. These won’t be factored in the tally, as predetermined shows don’t count towards my statistics: 
Shows renewed before the season started:
The 100 (Prediction: Renewed 37% ?)
Will & Grace (Prediction: Renewed 34% ?) 
Shows canceled before the season started (planned final season):
The Big Bang Theory (Prediction: Renewed 96% ?)
Jane the Virgin (Prediction: Renewed 55% ?)
iZombie (Prediction: Renewed 25% ?)
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (Prediction: Renewed 11% ?)
Gotham (Prediction: Renewed 2% ?)
While Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Gotham were close enough to the line that cancellation wouldn’t have been surprising, the other shows are performing well enough that they should have been renewed. With The Big Bang Theory, I know it was canceled because Jim Parsons didn’t want to do more. With iZombie, I have to wonder if maybe the show was ended so that Rob Thomas could move on to work on Veronica Mars on Hulu. Perhaps they just felt it was the right time to end the stories. I don’t watch Jane the Virgin myself, but I know Big Bang Theory and iZombie have been dragging a bit in story, so those endings were welcome.
