All American: Homecoming was renewed. While I would love to say this is no surprise because the prediction model was 100% confident in renewal, the truth is, with the new way the CW is being run, it's become harder to predict what they will do, so just about any renewal of previous CBS/WB owned content is certainly a surprise at this point. The same goes for Superman & Lois, which was also renewed, and also predicted as a certain renewal. This one though was renewed for a shorter season, which is often an indication that it would be the last season, but then again, the same could have been said for the current season, so who knows.

On the other hand, CW canceled Gotham Knights, which we had predicted as a likely renewal.

NBC canceled Young Rock, which we had leaning towards cancellation, so not much of a surprise there, although it was close. NBC also canceled Grand Crew, which we had as a certain cancellation, so definitely no surprise there.

Welcome to Flatch drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

The Rising upgrades from a certain cancellation to just leaning canceled.
