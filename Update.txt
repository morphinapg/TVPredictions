This wek, CBS premiered The Equalizer and CSI: Vegas. The Equalizer starts out predicted as a certain renewal, and CSI: Vegas starts out leaning towards cancellation.

ABC premiered The Rookie, Will Trent, and The Good Doctor. The Rookie starts out predicted as a certain renewal, Will Trent starts out as a likely renewal, and The Good Doctor is going to be the final season. ABC is likely satisfied with their decision to end The Good Doctor, because otherwise I would have predicted it as leaning towards cancellation.

As predicted, the prediction for Tracker drops this week, all the way from a certain renewal, to just leaning renewed. As this results in a better balance for CBS ratings, most of them will improve their predictions compared to last week as well.
