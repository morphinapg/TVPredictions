This post will likely be the last predictions for most of the remaining shows. Normally I would have wanted to train the prediction models a little further with the new data before posting this, as some renewals/cancellations have come in already, but there's a good chance we're going to be getting news like that every day, so because this could be the last chance to make predictions for these shows, I felt like it was a good idea to just post them now, even though I would have liked to train the AI models a little further. 

In a surprising move, CBS canceled East New York. I had this predicted as a certain renewal, with the prediction model expecting that CBS would have a lower renewal threshold for a first season show, but also having a full season order is usually a good predictor for renewal.

Originally, it was reported that S.W.A.T. was canceled, but then it seems a deal was made at the last minute to renew the show for a final season. We had this predicted as a likely renewal, so this was a close call, but ultimately a correct prediction.

FOX canceled Call Me Kat. While we had previously predicted this as a cancellation, recent decisions by FOX affected the prediction model which was most recently predicting it as a likely renewal. So that's a miss.

CW renewed Walker. We had this as leaning towards renewal, just above the renewal threshold, so this was a close call but we got this one right. They also canceled Walker: Independence, which we predicted as a certain cancellation. Any renewal from the CW at this point is actually pretty surprising given the information we have about the change in ownership of the network and the profitability of CW shows, but fans will be happy.

CBS canceled True Lies. We had this predicted as a certain cancellation, so this is no surprise.

Animal Control and Not Dead Yet both drop from certain renewals to just likely renewed.

Welcome to Flatch drops all the way from a likely renewal to likely canceled.

Fantasy Island drops from leaning towards renewal to likely canceled.

HouseBroken drops from a likely to certain cancellation.
