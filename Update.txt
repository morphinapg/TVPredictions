This week, FOX premiered Pivoting and Call Me Kat. Both shows performed quite poorly, dropping considerably on their second episodes, so both start out predicted as certain cancellations.

The CW premiered Superman & Lois, and Naomi. Superman & Lois started strong enough that it will start out predicted as a certain renewal, and Naomi starts out as a likely renewal. Remember though, as we're still waiting to hear what happens with the sale of the network, any CW predictions should be taken with a grain of salt.

S.W.A.T. and The Resident both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

American Auto, Kenan, and Our Kind of People all upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

Grand Crew upgrades from a likely cancellation to just leaning canceled.

The Big Leap and Ordinary Joe both upgrade from certain cancellations to just likely canceled.
