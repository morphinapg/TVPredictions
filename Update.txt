This week, Wellington Paranormal premiered its third season. The fourth (and final) season has already aired in New Zealand, so I'm marking this as Pre-renewed. Whether CW will air that season or not, I don't know. The show doesn't get good enough ratings where I would have expected a renewal otherwise, so it's possible CW may not decide to air season 4. 

Tom Swift drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.
