This will most likely be the last week of predictions for many shows, as I expect most shows to be decided within the next week. 

This week, ABC canceled Queens. This comes as no surprise, as we were 100% confident in this cancellation.

CBS renewed The Equalizer, FBI, FBI: International, and FBI: Most Wanted. Again, all 4 of these come as no surprise as we had them predicted as certain renewals.

NBC renewed Law & Order, and Law & Order: Organized Crime. We were 100% confident in renewal for both of these shows as well. 

Wommen of the Movement drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

All American: Homecoming and Magnum P.I. both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

How We Roll and Mr. Mayor both drop from likely to certain cancellations.
