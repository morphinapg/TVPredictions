This week, CBS premiered The Equalizer, NCIS: Los Angeles, B Positive, and SEAL Team. The Equalizer starts out as a likely renewal, while NCIS: Los Angeles is leaning towards cancellation and B Positive is likely to be canceled. SEAL Team is only airing as a promotion to Paramount+, so we will not be tracking it, but if it weren't, its ratings would have resulted in a certain cancellation prediction. Perhaps it will do better on the streaming platform. Another CBS show I missed last week was Ghosts, which has started out to good ratings, earning it a likely renewal prediction.

CW premiered Legends of Tomorrow, Batwoman, and Legacies. Legends of Tomorrow starts  out leaning towards renewal, but the other two start out leaning towards cancellation. Once again, the list of shows on CW is pretty small so far, so take these predictions with a grain of salt, although they should be better than last week's. 

NBC has a similar issue, as it seems heavily loaded with shows performing better than most network shows out there right now, which could be overestimating the renewal requirements. I do expect that Ordinary Joe will probably stay under the renewal threshold even after more shows start airing on NBC, but it's possible La Brea's rating may be high enough for renewal once more lower rated shows start airing. 

This week, I've also made some modifications to the episode counts of some shows on the database. The biggest problem here is that early in the season it can be difficult to know how many episodes have been ordered for the show. However, having a low episode order is often an indication of lower chances of renewal. For many shows, I default this at 13 episodes if the number is not known, but I've decided that for returning shows, if the exact number is not yet known, I will default the episode count at the number of episodes the previous season had. Once the episode count is known, I will update the entry, but I feel like assuming the season length will be the same as last year will improve predictions early on.
