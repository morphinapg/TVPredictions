This week, FOX renewed The Great North, The Cleaning Lady, and Alert. All 3 of these were predicted incorrectly! The Great North was the least surprising as we had that leaning towards cancellation with a 0% confidence in that prediction, but Alert and The Cleaning Lady were both predicted as likely cancellations, so those were surprises for sure.

ABC canceled Not Dead Yet. This one on the other hand was no surprise, as we had that as a likely cancellation.

So far, my prediction models have predicted 27 shows correctly, and 9 incorrectly. We now know the fate of most network TV shows. The exception is mostly the CW, who didn't have a network upfront this year. We will have to wait to hear news of most of their shows, but CBS also hasn't announced news about whether they plan to air any more Ghosts UK or SEAL Team on their network, but the prediction is 100% confident that they will not.


Wild Cards drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Sight Unseen drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.

Family Law drops from a likely to certain cancellation.


Also, if you missed my last facebook post, I will no longer be supporting the Android/Windows app, for a couple reasons. I plan to make significant modifications to the prediction model architecture this summer, which would require a significant rewrite of the app to make it compatible, but the app was written in a now unsupported framework, and I've had difficulty trying to push even minor updates because of that causing issues. For now I'm going to be focusing on the facebook posts, but I'm also looking into publishing these predictions on Substack, so stay tuned for information on that.

I will post this update to the app so that app users have this information, but that will be the final update.
