This week, FOX canceled Monarch. We had this predicted as a certain cancellation, with 81% confidence that it would be canceled, and unsurprisingly, we were right. Monarch was the lowest rated non-CW show on the air right now. This was the first cancellation (or renewal) news that we've had for this year's shows.

Also this week, Quantum Leap and S.W.A.T. both drop from likely renewed to just leaning towards renewal.

Bob's Burgers and Family Guy both upgrade all the way from leaning renewed to a certain renewal.

Blue Bloods drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning towards cancellation.

Ghosts, The Neighborhood, Young Rock, and The Rookie: Feds all upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning towards renewal.

9-1-1 upgrades all the way from leaning towards cancellation to a certain renewal.

The Resident upgrades from likely canceled to just leaning towards cancellation.

So Help Me Todd upgrades from a certain cancellation to just likely canceled.

Welcome to Flatch upgrades all the way from a certain cancellation to leaning towards renewal.
