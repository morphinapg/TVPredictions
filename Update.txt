This week, ABC renewed Abbott Elementary, as expected. We had this predicted as a certain renewal, with 97% confidence that it would be renewed.

While New Amsterdam was already renewed before the season began, NBC announced that the next season would be the last. While normally we do not track shows that were pre-decided before the season began, if the network does something to alter its fate, that can be reflective of how the network viewed the show's performance this year. As such, for the purposes of this  prediction model, we consider this the same as if it were canceled. Because of its pre-renewal status, we didn't discuss predictions for New Amsterdam's renewal or cancellation before, but looking at the data, last week it would have been predicted as leaning towards cancellation, so while it was close, we did predict this one correctly.

Also this week, NBC premiered The Thing About Pam and Transplant. While NBC claims The Thing About Pam is designed as a single season limited series, we still track these type of shows, because if they rate high enough, networks will usually be interested in continuing them in some way, even if that means using a different story for the next entry in that series. However, this show started out with lower ratings than the network would realistically need to renew it, so it starts out as a likely cancellation. Transplant had even lower ratings, which would normally have resulted in a certain cancellation prediction, but fortunately for fans of that show, it was already renewed before the season began.

CW also premiered Kung Fu and Charmed. Kung Fu rated high enough to earn it a certain renewal prediction, but charmed rated low enough to start out predicted as a certain cancellation. Note however, that the potential sale of the CW could mean that more shows could be canceled than these predictions suggest.
