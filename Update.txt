Based on TV Ratings data through June 3rd

Sorry about the delay, my computer has been busy for over a week now, but I finally managed to gather the ratings data and calculate new predictions.

CW premiered The Rising, Nancy Drew, and Barons. The Rising and Barons are shows that aired first in other countries. This will likely be a common trend going forward, with several shows ordered from other countries slated for the fall as well. This is one way the CW will likely be saving money, by not needing to produce their own shows anymore, and not renewing very many CBS/WB owned shows either. As of now however, this doesn't appear to be the greatest plan, as even taking into account their foreign status, the prediction model still expects both shows to be certain cancellations. Although as I've said before, CW predictions may be less accurate than usual as we still have only a small amount of data on how the new owners do things. Nancy Drew on the other hand is already announced as the final season.

Young Rock drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

HouseBroken drops from a likely to certain cancellation.
