It looks like reports from last year that said Magnum PI was picked up for two 10 episode seasons may have been accurate. Some sites were saying that season 5 was supposed to be 20 episodes, but only 10 episodes have aired at this point. It seems that most likely the remaining 10 episodes will air next season, but if they happen to air this summer, I can change the show's status back. For reference, the show had been predicted as a likely renewal, but would have increased to a certain renewal if the episode count was set at 10. 

American Auto drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.
