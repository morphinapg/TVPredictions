It turns out I had been missing the news that The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Bob's Burgers had already been renewed before the seasons started airing, so I have updated the charts to reflect this.

CBS renewed Tracker, which we had leaning towards renewal. I think there's a good chance the ratings will still drop closer to that renewal threshold, but the network appears to be confident they won't drop below it.

This week, CBS premiered a new show, Elsbeth. It performed lower than the network likely would have hoped, so it starts out predicted as leaning towards cancellation.

The Rookie drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

NCIS and Will Trent both upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

The Swarm, Fire Country, and So Help Me Todd all upgrade from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

CSI: Vegas and Children Ruin Everything both upgrade from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.
