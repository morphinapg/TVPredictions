This week, ABC canceled Home Economics. We had this leaning towards cancellation, so it was close, but we were right.

Also this week, NBC premiered The Irrational. The ratings started out pretty strong, compared to what we expect the network was likely hoping for, so it starts out predicted as a certain renewal.

FOX premiered Krapopolis, which also started out strong. FOX had already renewed this show about a year ago, and again recently for a third season, but if that weren't the case, we would have predicted this as a certain renewal as well. Clearly, FOX made the right call, although a surprising one so early in advance.

The Swarm upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.
