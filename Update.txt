This week, Son of a Critch drops from a certain renewal to just likely renewed.

Run the Burbs and Home Economics both drop from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Family Law upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.

Children Ruin Everything upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to likely renewed.

Coroner and The Wonder Years both drop from likely to certain cancellations.

Bump upgrades all the way from a certain cancellation to a certain renewal. It had a large and surprising increase in ratings this week. If that's a sign of where things will keep going, it may hold onto that, but if the ratings drop again, so may the prediction.

Note that all of the prediction models will be recalculated starting next week, as the AI treats September as the start of the new TV season, so previous years will be weighted differently which may cause some differences in the remaining predictions, but I will continue tracking these shows until the networks start premiering new shows this Fall. Because of the strikes, it's likely that very few shows will be premiering this fall. I will keep doing predictions as long as there are still shows that haven't had their fates decided yet, but note that there may be less content in my predictions throughout the fall than usual.
