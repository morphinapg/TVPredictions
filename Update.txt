This week, CBS premiered NCIS: Sydney and Ghosts UK. Both shows that were originally produced in other countries that CBS is using to fill their time slots because of the lack of original programming available due to this year's strikes. CBS already ordered both the first and second seasons of Ghosts UK, so fans of that show might be happy, because otherwise the model would have predicted it as leaning towards cancellation. NCIS: Sydney on the other hand starts out leaning towards renewal.

Found upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

The Spencer Sisters drops from leaning towards renewal to leaning canceled.

Bob's Burgers upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.
