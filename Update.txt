We have our first renewals of the year! NBC renewed Found and The Irrational. We had Found predicted as a certain renewal, and The Irrational was predicted as a likely renewal, so no surprises for either show.

CBS started airing the rest of season 5 of SEAL Team. Two years ago, they aired the first 4 episodes, with the rest premiering on Paramount+, but due to a lack of content because of the recent strikes, they decided to reach into their catalog to fill the airtime with these. While this seems like a temporary way to fill the airtime, if the show does well enough, it may be possible for CBS to air the next season as well. Right now, it starts out predicted as a likely renewal.

The Simpsons upgrades from a likely to certain renewal.

NCIS: Sydney drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

Children Ruin Everything upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to likely renewed.

The Spencer Sisters upgrades from leaning towards cancellation to leaning renewed.
