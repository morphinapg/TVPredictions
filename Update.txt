This week, NBC renewed Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, Chicago PD, Law & Order, and Law & Order: SVU. We had all 5 of these predicted as certain renewals with 100% confidence in that prediction, so obviously no surprises here.

It turns out the CW shows Run the Burbs and Everyone Else Burns were canceled back in November and I didn't see the news. Unfortunately, I never made predictions for these shows because they were listed as pre-renewed. So it turns out CW had previously ordered new seasons for these shows, but changed their mind after a few episodes aired. If I had made predictions, the most recent data would have suggested a likely renewal for Run the Burbs and Everyone Else Burns leaning towards cancellation. However, I can't say whether those predictions would have been the same back in November. Because I didn't make predictions for these shows, they won't count towards my statistics for the year, but likely would have changed them from 11/11 correct to 12/13 correct if they did. I only noticed this because my predictions app notified me that it thought Run the Burbs was likely going to be running into the Summer based on the number of episodes it has aired so far, which caused me to check if my ratings were incomplete, which is where I noticed the news.

9-1-1, Son of a Critch, and The Chosen all drop from certain renewals to just likely renewed.

Wild Cards, Night Court, and FBI all upgrade from likely to certain renewals.

Grey's Anatomy drops from a likely renewal to just leaning renewed.

FBI: Most Wanted upgrades from leaning towards renewal to likely renewed.

The Great North drops from leaning towards cancellation to likely canceled.
