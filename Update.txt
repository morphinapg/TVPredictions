This week, CW premiered two shows, Devils and Leonardo. Leonardo is produced in Italy, and has already been renewed by its original network. In that situation, we assume CW will also renew it, but it's possible they could decide not to, if the ratings aren't good enough. Looking at the ratings, they may be slightly lower than CW would want for a show like that, but time will tell. Devils however has not already been renewed, so based on the ratings, it starts out as a likely renewal.
